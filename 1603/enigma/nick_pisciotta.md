Additional Feature: Chunks of six

Notes: Did additional feature, but didn't get to cracking. Nice break out of a cipher object to generate the hash map. Also nice breakout of the offset generator. Could refactor the encrypt/decrypt methods because they are doing the same thing.

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
