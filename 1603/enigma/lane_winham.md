Additional Feature:

Notes:

* produced some good code that solves part of the project
* seemed to get off track a bit at the beginning and probably could have benefitted from more attention to the spec and the project directions
* code itself is ok -- main points would be to try to rely less on instance variables and to focus on extracting more small objects to hopefully help us reduce some of the duplication between multiple similar processes
* definitely need to focus on more testing and especially would like to see you focusing on this as the next step in the pseudocoding / outlining process -- pseudocode helps us describe what a thing needs to do and testing is a way to make that even more concrete and specific
* look for things that are similar but vary only in slight ways -- then figure out how to make an object that encapsulates the "similar" bits but allows the different bits to get passed in as an argument of some sort

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
