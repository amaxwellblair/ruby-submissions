Notes:

* got some good progress on the decrypt and encrypt
* seemed to have few things come apart at the seams at the last minute -- possibly there are some techniques we can look at to help avoid these gaps opening up
* sounds like we are doing good things from the pseudocoding / outlining / conceptualizing perspective
* now we need to start translating these ideas into more concrete expression via tests
* hopefully the tests also help us answer some of these questions around how do the different objects fit together

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
