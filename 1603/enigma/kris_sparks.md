Additional Feature:

Notes:

* making some progress but just need to do more stuff more quickly
* especially want to focus on the process portions and these initial steps in going from conceptual high level understanding into more specifically outlined small steps and designs that can be turned into implementation

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
