Additional Feature: Extra characters

Notes:

* encrypt and decrpyt both work with input and output files
* producing good results eventually -- code is actually clean and to the point
* just need to do more of it more quickly
* want you especially to focus on problem solving process and pseudocoding / outlining etc.
* try to figure out even smaller steps to take, phrase them in very specific terms, then implement them
* tests also look pretty good and are sufficient to cover the methods we have -- main comment here is i'd like to see more methods
and hence more tests -- especially for the difficult pieces we could be breaking these down even further and using smaller tests to
guide that process

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
