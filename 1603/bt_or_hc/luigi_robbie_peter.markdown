Notes:
* code is good. 
* Wished code had modules or refactored to parsing methods to be a little more agnostic 
* some good enumerables 


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP


### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
