Notes:

### 1. Functional Expectations

**1: Application is missing more than one base expectation**

### 2. Test-Driven Development

**3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality**

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

**3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP**

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

**3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring**

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

**2.5: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques**
