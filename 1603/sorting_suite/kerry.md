### Notes

* great job tackling project and some extensions
* algos are pretty easy to follow, especially if as described you tried to derive them with minimum reference to external sources.
* merge sort is the only one that starts to drift a bit from the expected implementation -- as we introduce steps that aren't necessarily essential
to the core algorithm, the code starts to get more complex

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

* 4: All three sort classes work as expected with 2 or more extensions.

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase
