## Rubric

This rubric works like so: In order to get a given score,
you must satisfy not only its description,
but also the requirements of all the scores beneath it.
ie if you did not satisfy the requirements of 2,
then you are not eligible for a 3, even if you satisfied it.

### Functional Expectations

**3: All three sort classes work as expected**

### Testing

**4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.**

### Ruby Style

**4: Any given chunk of code can be understood at a single level of abstraction**

### Organization

**4: Version control maintains the codebase**
