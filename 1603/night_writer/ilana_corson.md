Notes:
* Keys test - 10 tests
* read - four tests
* More robust testing, need to see that actual text is being encoded and decoded.
* use constants instead of instance variables.
* pull file Io stuff out to its own class
* I like how the decoding is all in keys and things just refer to it.
* Does only do numbers in one direction


### 1. Overall Functionality
* 2.5: Application converts to Braille and back successfully


### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
