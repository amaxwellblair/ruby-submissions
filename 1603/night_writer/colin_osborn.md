Notes:

* 4 tests in reader
* 8 tests in writer
* Project did not exactly follow spec
* only writes, does not read
* Uses a characters module which is awesome
* think about how you would have two runner files that refer to another single
class to convert from braille to text and back.


### 1. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
