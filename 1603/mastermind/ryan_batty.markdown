Notes:

* got all base features -- started on the high score extension but made the right call to
focus on the baseline
* like seeing several classes at work to shoulder the various responsibilities of the game
* think the classes are well-named and you're doing a good job of passing instance back and forth between one another when necessary
* biggest issue with class divisions is how uneven they are -- Game is doing much more work than some of the others, and some the jobs that it's doing really fit into the other classes (UI printing / getting, etc)
* Probably could even carve out a few more objects from the game -- maybe one dedicated for managing code sequences or checking guesses

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods and collections

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.
