Notes:

* completed base expectations and 1 extension
* overall pretty clean and consistent linked list implementation
* looked at a few examples where test coverage could be improved around certain use cases
* talked about what it would look like to remove pre-counting and take count logic out of the other methods
* small hiccups around JungleBeat interface but these were pretty easy to straighten out


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
