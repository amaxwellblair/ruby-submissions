Notes:
* 26 tests total, all passing. Some more edge cases would be nice.
* well written code, some small areas can be refactored/remove unnecessary
assignment of variables.
* Loved the handling of an error case and the fact that it was tested.
* defaulted to use of attr_reader instead of attr_accessor
