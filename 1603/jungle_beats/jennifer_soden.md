Notes:

* base expectations working as expected through i6
* lets us change the rate and voice by passing a parameter wooo
* implementation is pretty clean and easy to follow - experimenting with breaking out lots of helper methods as private methods to
decompose some of the more complicated processes
* this is effective at keeping method lengths shorter
* to some extent makes the logic a bit harder to follow as it gets pulled out into different places
* recursion is pretty effective throughout the code -- seem to have a pretty good grasp of this now and are applying it effectively

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
