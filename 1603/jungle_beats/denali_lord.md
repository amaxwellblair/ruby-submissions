Notes:

* delivered a successful project
* completes all the base features and added a couple extensions
* took a lot of advantage of adding the beats into an array and leveraging that to make most of the other methods easier
* testing is good -- next time will be looking to see more of these additional cases covered (what happens when there are 0, etc)
* but glad to see that we're successfully manipulating the tests from a mechanical perspective
* looked at a bunch of style / formatting things -- not too worried about these now but hope to see that sort of stuff a bit tidier going forward

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
