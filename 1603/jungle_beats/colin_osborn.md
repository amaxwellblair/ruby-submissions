Notes:

* code is quite clean and straightforward -- code we have follows the actual algorithms closely so its easy to follow
* have quite a lot of tests especially on the list itself which is cool
* however even with all the tests we do have there are still some pretty basic cases that fell through the cracks -- need to keep an eye on all these details when testing and make sure we're covering all the cases from the ground up
* this partly comes back to a question of process -- make sure we are still building up from basic to more complex cases; this will likely help us avoid missing some of these fundamental cases
* got all the basic features done and added a couple extensions

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
