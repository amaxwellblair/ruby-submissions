Notes:
* 25 tests total, could use some more edge cases, a teensy bit of testing
redundancy
* Code was generally good, to_string was built using the functionality of an
array, breaking the spirit of a linked list.
* Code has some unnecessary variable assignment.
* Be careful to use attr_readers and attr_accessors properly

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
