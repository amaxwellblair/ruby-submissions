Notes:
* 21 tests, one skipped.
* Implemented up to iteration 4.
* Look into using a Test helper file to remove redundancy from tests.
* Some longer methods, look to pull out chunks of code into separate methods.
* Look into when you dont need to instantiate a class and use a module instead or even class methods. 
* Some methods could have been broken out into separate classes/modules to improve organization.

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
