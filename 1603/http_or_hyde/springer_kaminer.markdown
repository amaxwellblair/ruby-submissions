Notes: 
* 20 tests total
* 100 percent coverage
* I liked how granular the tests were.
* Some opportunities for refactoring in pulling out conditionals to methods and pulling out long chains into methods.

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but suffers from some repetition or lack of consistency between components.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
