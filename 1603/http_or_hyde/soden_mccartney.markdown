Notes:

* 17 tests all pass
* Would like to have seen a little more in depth testing, testing for content as well as existance.
* 91 percent test coverage.
* Some opportunities to refactor with longer methods.
* Overall code was clear and easy to follow.
* Think about how you can pull out unnecessary variable assignment to separate methods.
* 

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but suffers from some repetition or lack of consistency between components.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
