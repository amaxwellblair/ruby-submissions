Notes: I liked the implementation of the project. There were a few long methods but that is to be expected with what was happening. One thing I liked was that variables were clear and I could see what was going on. I liked their test. I encouraged them to make sure to test edge cases.

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* I like the naming and the effort to stick to some single responsibility methods and classes :D


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
