Notes:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* There were a couple of long methods. That's kind of hard to get away from esp with the main file. What I did see is that they moved the logic into other methods within the other classes. I liked that. I stuck to the single-responsiblity rule. 

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.
*  I liked the test. Some of the classes were tested indirectly. I game them a 3.5 because of how broken down they where. There is some room for improvement but I feel like they were pretty much there.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* this goes hand in hand with the FR&S. I liked how this group was holding to keeping things clean and simple. One method does one thing.
