Notes:

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4



**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* First group to use a module. I liked that. Code was pretty clean. Some portions had pieces and parts to look at and work on but with what they had i think they were okay. 


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
* little to no test. 

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
* For the most part their code had single lined methods and had single responsibility. I feel if they had more time things could of been a little tider but I do like the implementation of the classes.
