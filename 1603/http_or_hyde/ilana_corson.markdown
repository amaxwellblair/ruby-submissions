Notes:
* 8 tests, could have used better more indepth testing and coverage.
* Game doesnt work.
* Use methods to simplify conditionals
* 

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2.5: Application implements iterations 0 - 3


**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.


### 4. Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
