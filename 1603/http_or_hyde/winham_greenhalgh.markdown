Notes: Got through iteration 3. The code was well written up to that point. A 2 for testing because the word search functionality wasn't tested in the server test.

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
