Notes:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5


**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* I felt that there test where there. They did test for some edge-cases which I think got them their 3. I would of liked to see more assertions and more prying into the code base. But from what I could see they were moving on the right track. I just wanted a little more. 

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but suffers from some repetition or lack of consistency between components.
*  This is a soft three. I feel that they were showing glimpses of being able to do this part well. I think time just got the best of them


### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5:  Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.
*  This probably would error on the 3 side. I saw an effort to really try and make this piece happen.


### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
