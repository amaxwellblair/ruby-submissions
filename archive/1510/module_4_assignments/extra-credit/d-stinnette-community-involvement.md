# Mod 4 Extra Credit

## Community Involvement (10 to 50 points)

On Saturday, March 19 I joined 10 other Turing students to help Rachel put on a
coding workshop for her 9th grade class visiting from Las Vegas. We facilitated
a Q&A session, demoed projects, and led them through an intro to Scratch
tutorial. About 3 hours total.
