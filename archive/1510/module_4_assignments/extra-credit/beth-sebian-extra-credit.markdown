# Mod 4 Extra Credit

## Community Involvement (10 to 50 points)
On Saturday, March 19, during intermission week, I volunteered with 10 other Turing students to work with Rachel's 9th grade class visiting from Las Vegas. I demoed my police data project. For me, it was a 2 hour commitment.
On Monday 3/21 and 3/28, I attended Denver's Code for America's. The meeting is 3 hours long, I stayed for the first 1.5 hours. During the first meeting, I went through an orientation session. In the second meeting, I volunteered to be a notetaker.

## Open Source Contributions (10 to 50 points)
As a posse leader of the Pahlka posse, I have facilitated the development of our affordable housing app. This has been a large commitment, involving approximately 5-6 hours a week. During the first week, I facilitated a 1.5 hour introductory meeting and planning session, and then a three hour workshop for our group over the weekend. Since then, our group meets for 1.5 hours after classes on Monday, and 1 hour during Thursday lunch. I put in approximately 45 minutes of planning before each meeting.
After our initial workshop, our group agreed to focus on affordable housing. We saw this problem in the current apartment search market: online apps help housing seekers identify apartments based on criteria that appeals to more affluent people (proximity to coffee shops, whole foods, etc.). We want to build an app that will help people manage transportation limitations and find locations near public services.
For our sessions, my work has involved the following:
- Developing agendas for our meeting
- Dividing our group into sub-work groups focused on UX, database design, and mapping technology.
- Writing user stories and tests to drive sub-groups' work

Our posse also participated in the Hackathon. I coordinated our activities for the day.
