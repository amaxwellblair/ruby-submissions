# Mod 4 Extra Credit

## Community Involvement (10 to 50 points)

I won the posse cup for my posse last module.  I did it by mopping up a wet floor and cleaning out a few fridges.  
This doesn't deserve any extra credit points I just think it's funny as hell.

PS. Thank you so much for teaching us this module.  As with all the staff here, you guys were incredibly helpful.  I'm going to miss Turing and I hope you all know what an impact you and this school have had on my life.  Because of Turing and the hard work and incredible hearts of the Teachers and staff, I have the skill set to get into a decent career, get out of debt and become financially responsible.  You guys are incredible.  Thanks!
