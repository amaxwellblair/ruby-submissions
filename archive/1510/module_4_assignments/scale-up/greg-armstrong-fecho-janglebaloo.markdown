### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

* React. All of it. I had no idea about its component-style design or the way events bubble up with data flowing down. After wrapping my head around it, I really like the way it handles things and want to continue to learn more about it.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application

* I feel as though I was able to reach the point of a minimum viable product that is solid and looks nice to the user. A combination of job interviews / hiring events / 1510 graduation night planning left me with little time to go above and beyond in this project, but Im still really happy with what I produced and am going to continue to add to it for my own purposes afterwards. Now that I understand the combo of Electron / React for desktop apps, I'll most likely continue to make small apps for ideas I have.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Part 1:
  - Title: Electron / React Applications
  - Summary: Electron / React is a really cool combination of technologies for creating simple desktop apps. React's way of doing things was a little odd to understand at first, but once you're there its really powerful.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?

  * I had no idea about how to even go about a music player, especially using React which I had never really touched before.

  - How do you feel about those risks?

  * I feel as though I surmounted the risks in a satisfactory manner, but I didnt have enough time to go above and beyond due to other engagements (hiring events / interviews / graduation planning).
