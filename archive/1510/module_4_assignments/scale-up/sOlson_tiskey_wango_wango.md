# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the Work you Completed Over the Week  
I made a React Native IOS app that displays the currency and expense data generated by my Ramble Map project. This involved learning the basics of React Native and Xcode. The app is called Ramble App. Ramble Map & Ramble App. Wowwwww. To implement this I built out a few API endpoints to hit in the mapping application. I plan on putting this app in the Apple App Store after polishing it a little more.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.  
I didn't know how to use Xcode to simulate deploying to different devices. So I learned how to do that, and also how to deploy the app to my actual phone, and how do basic debugging in Xcode.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback  
Well, being apart from the main TrotBox group, I didn't have much of a grasp on what they were doing, and people didn't really know much about what I was doing with React Native. But we were able to point out commented out code or other little mistakes.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups  
It was nice to hear what everyone was working, but as I wasn't involved or invested in the main project, it was more nice to hear about what else was going on in their lives.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!  
I enjoyed having the freedom to pursue a project of my own choosing, and I think it's a good part of Module 4 to have more options like that.
