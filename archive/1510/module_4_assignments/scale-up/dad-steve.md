### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- I'm happiest that I have a reasonable philosophy of React, especially regarding state and props. I had no idea what was going on in the React code-alongs, but now I want to continue working with React.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
- User can set a work interval timer
- User can stop that work interval timer
- Pomodoro initiates and user has no control over their computer
- Pomodoro has cryptographic exit feature
- Responsive custom tray icon

Ultimately, we replaced stripe functionality with the ability to break out of a pomodoro. We figured this extension was more central to the purpose of the application.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
    -    I worked with my beloved but unruly son, Jordan.
    -    Rather than copying Steve's file app, we took on a unique project.
    -    React and Electron project in JavaScript instead of a Rails project in Ruby.
    -    We dealt with JavaScript timers, which isn't always straight forward
  - How do you feel about those risks?
    - I have a much better understanding of React, so it was all worthwhile.
    - I know what client side development looks like.
    - I appreciate how much harder React/JS is to debug.
    - Most importantly, Jordan and I were able to spend time together.
