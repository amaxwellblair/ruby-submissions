### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- I didn't know about electron, react, main processes or rendering. This whole project was a shot in the dark.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
I finished everything I set out to including:
- note clone with auto-save
- remembering what was opened on close
- create and email gist
- sticky note

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

[Blog Post](https://medium.com/@dan.j.winter/building-desktop-apps-with-electron-and-react-at-turing-school-985abd48e70c#.yz7gstfuc)

I'm hoping my refactoring is enough to convince you to read the coming blog post on Monday.


## Risk Taking
  - Honestly, I felt like most of this was slapping together tutorials into a cohesive app. Except for the sticky notes. I'm proud of that. But, I learned a ton and I'm finally understanding how React components can be broken down and reused in new contexts and how electron works with the main and rendering processes. I'm excited to build another app with it...once I have time again.
