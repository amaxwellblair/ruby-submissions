# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics
### Summarize the Work you Completed Over the Week
  * Developed MVP vision: API-centric website, with professional data standardization and robust documentation.
  * Identified resources for documentation, including Swagger
  * Identified 15 datasets to develop first 5 (of 8) data categories. Required a couple hours of research exploring available datasets.
  * Drafted columns for first data category table.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
  * API documentation templates exist
  * Data standardization feels very *political*. If, hypothetically, this site gained attention, the columns and data attributes I prioritize could affect how agencies across the country collect data. It's unlikely the site would gain a large audience, but the power of "setting norms" is overwhelming.
  * I am most comfortable building with TDD -- feel a little lost without that structure.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted
  ["Lessons Creating a Police Data API"](http://bethsebian.github.io/civic_tech/2016/04/17/lessons-creating-a-police-data-api.html)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
  * It was helpful to have _a little_ (i.e. 1) experience submitting a comment on Secor's code...and realizing how easy it was.
  * It was a little difficult jumping into a project I was not very familiar with. Without that context, it wasn't immediately clear how I could be most helpful.
  * The code I made comments on was written in a way to isolate methods for the purpose of testing. I gave commentary from the perspective of readability. In retrospect, I may have been better of giving a thumbs up to the code, instead of nit-picking.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
  * Positive. I'm _really_ looking forward to a professional setting with this type of routine. I love that structure.
  * Stand-ups aside, I was aware during my check-ins with Tess and Meeka of being a little disordered when I presented my work and concerns. I need a better structure/routine for briefing others, and more succinct questions. When I don't know exactly what I'm looking for or what direction I'm headed, this is especially a problem.
