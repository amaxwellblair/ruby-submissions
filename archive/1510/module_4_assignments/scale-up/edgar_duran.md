-[Hint - pre-work list is in the lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/looking_for_project.markdown)
-I really enjoyed reading about Factory Girl tips. I've never quite figured out how to properly use Factory GIrl for testing despite having tried many times

### Summarize what you worked on
-I started by taking on the issue of adding the AngelList API to the app in order to scrape it for jobs. After writing some code and doing a bit of research I realized the API would not be useable for the project due to permission constraints. 
-I then took on the issue of creating a Job show page. I was able to create one with the same styling as the home page.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
-It was great to see how the process worked. It felt like working on a real team.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
-I found it very helpful because others were able to give feedback and reinforcement on what I was doing. I received advice on how to proceed as well as encouragement when I thought I wasn't making much progress. 

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?
-I would like to see more category navigation as well as grouping of similar jobs or jobs by city.
