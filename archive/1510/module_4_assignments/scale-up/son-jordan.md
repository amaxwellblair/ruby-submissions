### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- To be completely honest our approach to React was god awful until a major refactoring session yesterday. It felt like we were fighting React until yesterday!

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
- User can set a work interval timer
- User can stop that work interval timer
- Pomodoro initiates and user has no control over their computer
- Pomodoro has cryptographic exit feature
- Responsive custom tray icon

Ultimately, we replaced stripe functionality with the ability to break out of a pomodoro. We figured this extension was more central to the purpose of the application. <- Dad

Son - It was also far simpler to implement the quotation system. I learned to avoid the hard things in life from dad.


## 3 Part Blog Post:
  - Forthcoming, greatness takes time. Something my dad does not have much left of.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
    -    I worked with my old dad, Steve. His father farts got far worse as the project continued. I think stress triggers this response.
    -    Rather than copying Steve's file app, we took on a unique project.
    -    React and Electron project in JavaScript instead of a Rails project in Ruby.
    -    We dealt with JavaScript timers, which isn't always straight forward
  - How do you feel about those risks?
    - We have a much better understanding of React, so it was all worthwhile.
    - We know what client side development looks like.
    - We appreciate how much harder React/JS is to debug.
    - Most importantly, Steve and I were able to spend time together.

    (Notice how I used we rather than I here? this is because I am not an entitled baby boomer like my dad. He is spending all the social security and always is telling me "Just walk into any old place and ask for one like I did when I was your age! I worked in a factory my whole life, bought my first house at 24!". Screw you dad! YOU DONT KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE! I CANT JUST WALK INTO ANY OLD FACTORY AND GET A BOLO TIE MANUFACTURING JOB LIKE YOU!)
