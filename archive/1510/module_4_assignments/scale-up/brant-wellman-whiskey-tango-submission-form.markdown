# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the Work you Completed Over the Week
  - The first few days of the week were spent de-coupling the basic 3D Engine code of our Gametime project from the actual gameplay code and publishing it into it's own repo. I then moved on to fleshing out the details of my blog post. Finally, I went back to the repository and refactored some of the code to make it a little easier to work with as a standalone repository along with refining the Readme to reflect what is actually there and how to use the basic functionality.

### Link(s) to Your Work
  - [3D Graphics Engine](https://github.com/brantwellman/3D-graphics-engine)

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
  - I did research into how to publish this code as an npm module. The npm docs are not super helpful, but I did find a couple of blogs that give me the impression it may not be that difficult, and this may be something that I will pursue in the near future.


### Link to blog post(s) submitted
  - [Creating a 3D Engine - the Setup and Rendering Points](http://www.co-de-pendency.com/creating-a-3d-engine-the-setup-and-rendering-points/)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
  - I like getting feedback from others on my work and I think the PR approach is the best way to do it.
  - It was a bit difficult giving feedback to others, especially the other Whisky Tango peeps. Not knowing exactly what they were working on (or even knowing the language they were using) made it difficult to feel like I could give constructive feedback.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
  I liked participating in the daily stand ups because they added some additional focus to the day. Without having something during the day that requires you to reflect on what you have accomplished or on what you want to accomplish, it's possible to just continue to "work forward", and this may or may not have any actual focus to it. Having to report out verbally to the team each day required me to actually consider what it was that I have accomplished and make some decisions on what I would like to accomplish next. Breaking this out into 24 hour blocks also made tasks feel much more manageable. Not that my tasks weren't manageable in this case, but I can imagine a situation where you are working on a large project and the big-picture goals may seem unmanageable, but by breaking them into smaller pieces things things are more easily accomplished.  

  I also appreciated hearing report-outs from the boxtrot team members. Hearing the wins and losses daily and how some of them needed to interact and collaborate at times, gave me a sense of how working on a team in the "real world" might be like.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
  - Is it worth pushing to publish as an npm module?
    - Other possible resources to use?
