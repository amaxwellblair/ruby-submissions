### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
-[Stubbing](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-stub-external-services-in-tests)
I didn't know you could set up Webmock as it's own stub. I thought you used it with VCR. So that was interesting. The other two
ways I've used so now I know a third.

### Summarize what you worked on
  
  I built a scheduler that was dry so now pulling in jobs is automated.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
My experience doing the PR reviews was one of learning and time. I submitted I think 4 pull requests, and I had to redo 3 of them 
because they weren't dry or weren't set up correctly.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I was there every day except the beginning of one due to a preplanned job interview. I was the note taker. I enjoyed them
and hearing what the team was working on. 

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?
I really want to see the search by technology functionality implemented. I almost wish I would have worked on this but
instead decided to do something I haven't done before.
