# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Link(s) to the PRs or Issues You Picked Up
-[#34 Add Integration Tests for WWR](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/issues/34)

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
-I didn't know you could create an entirely fake service using Sinatra or any other DSL. I figured VCR, Webmock, were the only ways to go about doing this. They were the only ways I knew about up to this point at least.

### Summarize what you worked on
-I worked on implementing We Work Remotely Integration Tests. I practically didn't get very far at all, as I switched my focus in the beginning of this project to prepare for my new job. This wasn't the best idea looking back, especially since I repeated the module in order to get the most out of it, but it was somewhat inevitable. My excitement just won't allow me to do anything else this week besides dream about where this school and this profession might take me in the future. I'm super lucky and I know it. I'm thankful this has been my biggest problem this week.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
By the time I had realized I hadn't made any PR reviews, many of them were already merged so I would scavenged for a new one whenever the opportunity came. Most of the ones I found were very relationship centric, having a large dialogue between two people and clearly these two people are trying to get something very specific done, so I would make a small comment wherever I could, and clean up branches that had been merged but not deleted whenever I could.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I love standups. I think its a very effective way to get people to deliver and also to find out where everyone's mood is at the beginning of the work day.

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?
I would like for Lookingfor to have login functionality. I would like it to have a nicer front end. I would like it to incorporate LinkedIn/Github/Dice jobs.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
I'm sorry for my distractions this week!
