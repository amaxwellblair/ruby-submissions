### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
-[Hint - pre-work list is in the lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/edit/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/bartleby_project.markdown)
- One thing that was very new to us was the actual process of creating a desktop application. We hadn't done anything like this in mod 1, and since mod 2 almost all of our work has been on web apps. We were rather surprised by how easy it is with Electron. We expected less of the process to be "done for us" by Electron, and definitely feel that working with it significantly expanded our understanding of the tools and options at our disposal as developers.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
- We were able to implement all of the basic functionality that we aimed for, including creating, opening, saving, displaying, and editing notes. We were also able to style the app, add options for light and dark themes, pull 'last modified' dates from the file system, and implement a search feature.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
    * Using React in concert with Electron was a risk in and of itself. There was definitely a noteworthy learning curve working with these new tools, and even JavaScript itself is relatively new to us. We considered doing the Boxtrot project in Rails for a refresher, but felt we'd learn more on the Fecho project.

    * We chose to first focus on getting as comfortable as possible with the resources at hand. Part of the challenge of working with new technology is figuring out how to incorporate other frameworks together. For example, using jQuery to add search functionality proved to be more difficult than it would have been using a more structured skeleton. Additionally, we added functionality to change the theme color of our app from dark to light, added a search feature, and experimented with learning to pull more data from the file system (like 'last modified' dates for files).

  - How do you feel about those risks?
    * Even though the app is simple, and we could easily build something like this out in Rails now, it proved to be fairly difficult in a new language/framework. We were definitely glad to take on the challenge though, and that we opted to do the project that is further outside of our comfort zone. Doing this also made us feel that picking up new languages and frameworks is not quite as daunting a task as it would seem at first.

Points: (max 150)

### Rubric

### Blog Post (60 Points - 15 points per section)  

### Participation (30 points)
  * 30: Developer participated daily in courses and stand ups with the group. Developer worked on multiple features or one feature that instructor feels is exceptionally difficult.
  * 20: Developer was absent for 1 lesson, did not participate actively in lessons and peer reviews. Developer worked on one or two 'easier' features.
  * 0: Developer was absent for > 1 lesson, did not participate actively in lessons and peer reviews. Did not deliver or almost deliver any features.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
  * 30: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.
  * 10: Developers but did not build any features.

#### Extension (20 points)

  * Developer contributes to or creates an NPM module/library.
