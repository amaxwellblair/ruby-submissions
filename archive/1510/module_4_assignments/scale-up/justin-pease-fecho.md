### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- What excited me about doing this project was the ability to create a desktop app.  I was very excited to be able to say that I knew how to do that even if electron does pretty much all the work for me.  Something that I learned from the pre-work was that a chrome browser was just a window.  I have always mentally connected that to the web so learning that I can use a chrome browser to make a window and write to it for a desktop app was very interesting.  I just never though much about what a window was before.  

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
I honestly didn't get very far at all.  The new language of ES6, combined with the React framework and the Electron framework was too much for me.  I learned a lot working with Dan for a few days but after that I was just not soaking in much content.  I implemented making a new file/note to write to.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
  - I think taking this project on at all was a risk.  I really should have done an independent project to work through my javascript skills but I wanted to learn React, and Electron and ES6.

  - How do you feel about those risks?
  - I feel mixed.  I had a very tough week and don't feel that I really learned enough about Electron or React, and I still need more practice with JS but I am glad I got some exposure to all those new technologies.
