### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
While I didn't have a need for this with my feature, I didn't know you could
stub APIs in tests, I thought the only way to test external services was to use
VCR. Also pulling down the production database felt like toying with dark magic
at first but I quickly learned to embrace the madness and get some real records
into my database.

### Summarize what you worked on
As a user viewing a company show page, we should be able to see the company
name, basic company information, and a list of all jobs related to that company.

- Company name and number of jobs available headline the page
- All jobs related to the company listed below
- Jobs ordered with most recent at the top
- Paginated so that no more than 10 jobs show per page
- Company has a list of technologies that have been tagged across all job
postings below the job listings
- Link to company show was added to the index page for jobs

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
It's a good practice I wish we had more time for during projects at Turing. For
one, on large projects like this it keeps me involved with other features I
otherwise would not have a chance to see. And two, it's helpful to see how
others would tackle the same problem, whether they're more experienced or on the
same level as me.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I was part of daily stand ups in my old job and I really enjoy them. Even in
sales, it was helpful for me to hear daily updates on the direction of the
product I was selling and provide customer feedback to the dev team. At Turing,
it was helpful to practice getting a feel for the daily routine we'll have once
we've graduated and aren't living like peasants anymore.

### What features would you like to see LookingFor have in the future?
- A search feature where you can browse jobs by location or technology would be
really useful
- Links in the job show page to the live job application page

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
