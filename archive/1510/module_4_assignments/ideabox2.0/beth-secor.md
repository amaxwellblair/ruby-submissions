# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* [Inline editing of a title](https://github.com/bethsecor/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js#L187). I am proud of this because it took me a while to figure out all of the pieces (undoing the change if they hit escape, unfocusing the edit box when they hit return). I do think it could be more refactored though.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* [One javascript file](https://github.com/bethsecor/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js), which when I tried to pull them apart into separate files I had issues.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
