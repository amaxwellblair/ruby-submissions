### Concept and Features

Does it have the expected features?

* 75 points - Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.

### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 25 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Client-Side Application

* 20 points - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.

### Test-Driven Development

* 25 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tests at controller and unit levels. All controller/routes are tested. There are no failing tests.

### Interface

* 4 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Workflow

* 5 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
