# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1 (2D scrolling with cati)

  - Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal

    [Code](https://github.com/danjwinter/game-time-t-rex/blob/master/lib/index.js#L7-L45)

  - Did you deviate from the instructions?

    No. We were able to get 2D scrolling with obstacles streaking across the screen toward our player.

  - Questions, Comments, Concerns?

    We are concerned about memory leaks or garbage collection when we generate obstacles. Will need to recycle obstacles when they move off screen and re-populate at end of screen  

## Next Steps?

- What do you feel the next steps should be?

  Refactor game loop to extract business logic.
  Get cactus generation to be more efficient to avoid lagging.
  Collision detection
