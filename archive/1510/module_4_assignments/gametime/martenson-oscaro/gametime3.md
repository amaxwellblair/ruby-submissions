# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOALS
  ![gif](http://g.recordit.co/NGdQmtsJwN.gif)  
  
  - We needed to complete basic gameplay mechanics, allowing the ball to go under building walls, end the game if the ball hits a building wall, allow walls to detect other walls, and be able to increase the velocity of the ball.
  - We didn't test and refactor as much yet, as the gameplay mechanics were more difficult than we assumed, but they are done now.
  - Refactoring some large functions.


## Next Steps?

- Building the user interface and adding more tests.
