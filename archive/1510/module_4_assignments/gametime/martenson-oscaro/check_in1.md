### Game Name

TraptBall

### Give a Basic Description of the Game

The object of the game is to trap the ball(s) in a small section of the canvas. The canvas is made smaller by clicking and dividing the screen without letting the ball hit the wall as it is built.

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

Level One: One ball bounces around the canvas. The user clicks anywhere on the canvas and draws either a vertical or horizontal line that divides the canvas into a smaller section. Once the ball is trapped within a section of canvas that is a certain percentage of the original, user wins.

Level Two: Two balls bounce around the canvas. Same Concept.

Level Three: Three balls bounce around the canvas.

All of this is happening to awesome Trapt music.

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

Eventually incorporating gravity/ball movement/collision detection with some cool effects.

### What have you accomplished so far?

Right now we have a canvas and a single ball that bounces around and stays contained within the canvas. If you click on the canvas a line is drawn horizontally but there is no collision detection set on the canvas yet.

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

-----

## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)
  * 50 Points
  * nice start with the board, the ball and creating horizontal walls

### Instructor's goals for next check in
  * add collision detection with the walls + ball (when the ball hits a wall, it should bump off)
  * implement scenario where the ball is trapped -> change background color to communicate elimination of the board
  * create vertical walls
  * Start testing - test Ball, Wall and Wrapper object.
