## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

e.g.

- SnakeTron moves around screen
- SnakeTron can eat pellets
- When a pellet is eaten, the tron character gains points
- If the Tron hits itself or the other player, the game ends, points added
- Tron is similar in style to Tron game

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Tron moves around screen
- Tron can eat pellets
- Tron can move perpetually in one direction
- Is the Tron hits itself, the game ends
- If the Tron hits the other, game ends

### What have you accomplished so far?

Basic functionality (photo above)

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

Hector is leaving on Wednesday so we have to have this done by Tuesday. When should we have the functionality complete if we want to implement AI for the second player?

## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)

50

### Instructor's goals for next check in

- Refactor keyBoarder and Player move method so that’s it’s a little clearer and more expressive with the idea that an AI has to be able to change or move a second player.
- Look into KeyPress and Key ‘release’ and different window input styles

- Collision detection should have a first pass.
  - Snake can’t go past walls
  - Snake can detect when it hits itself

### Feedback?

Note: Due to the timeline of one partner leaving, instructor approval was given to spend less focus on the UI wrapper.
