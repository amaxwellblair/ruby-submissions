# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1

Player can shoot left and right, but not up and down because they don't need to yet for level one.

- We decided that the projectiles need to indicate the color of the portal that is going to be opened.
- So this added the feature of being able to switch between orange and blue projectiles.
- We need to add an indicator of what type of projectile will be fired.

### GOAL 2

Add walls around the character.

- Collision detection for blocks completed.

### GOAL 3

Create/add the level-completed-door.

### GOAL 4

When the character moves through one of the portals and shows up in the other one (she can move back and forth)

- Super close to getting this done, however, this is dependent on portal creation (which is a goal in and of itself - only two portals can exist at one time, one orange and one blue, if another portal is created of one color, the current one must be switched off).
- Portal creation depends on projectile collision, which we are also super close to getting completed.

### GOAL 5

When the character walks through the level-completed-door, an alert box should communicate that the level is completed.

- Once we have goal 4 done, this should be super easy to implement.


## Next Steps?

- Completing Level One.
- Beginning layout for Level Two. Level Two should go a bit faster since we will have all the pieces coded for collision detection and portal creation and such.
- Add how many levels player has completed (our version of scores).

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?

- Occasional lagging of the game. Started when we moved the event listeners to their own class.
