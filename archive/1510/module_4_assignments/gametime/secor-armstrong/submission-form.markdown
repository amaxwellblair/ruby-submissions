## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?

YES! Four sweet, sweet levels.

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?

No extensions.

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?

 - The game itself is harder than many other games implemented in the past.
 - Level Four is pretty amazing and challenging to beat ([video link](http://recordit.co/pR03Mk2xuc)).
 - We added a song that plays while you are playing the game.

----

## Risk Taking

- The game was pretty ambitious to take on. Greg lied to me on the first day telling me it was more possible than he actually thought it was.
- How do we feel? We crushed it.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- [This method in detector](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/portal2d/blob/master/lib/detector.js#L37). We refactored this ugly, ugly method ([here's the commit](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/portal2d/commit/0e75f8df9d977079654b9ff5bbdafb9600475d47#diff-7f866b2c12c2300201c99cd9fffd7713R35)).

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- Our [game class](https://github.com/GregoryArmstrong/portal2d/blob/master/lib/game.js) is not great, there's long methods and duplication.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
