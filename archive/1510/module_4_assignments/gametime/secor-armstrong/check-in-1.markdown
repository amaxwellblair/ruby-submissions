- Player cannot jump to other side, there is a pit of fire between cliffs, if they fall in, GAME OVER.

* When the character moves through one of the portals and shows up in the other one (she can move back and forth)
* Create/add the level-completed-door 
* When the character walks through the level-completed-door, an alert box should communicate that the level is completed
* Add walls around the character, she has to shoot portals in order to escape and get to the level-completed-door
