  - When you hit the space bar to change the projectile color, the browser moves, we might just change the key to do this.

- Player can jump up on a block.

### GOAL 4

- Level Three Complete!
- Player can shoot portals up and down.
- Beth clearly has trouble with this level LOL:

![portal-level-four](http://g.recordit.co/y7ZccVq0dk.gif)

- Need to end game after level 3 instead of restarting level 3.
- End of level happens so abruptly, after the last portal creation, we should perhaps move the door to the right a couple blocks.

## Next Steps?

- Add more styling to beginning and end of game.
- Add styling to page surrounding canvas.
- "Score" the game by showing number of attempts and highest level completed.
- Make sure game runs smoothly, and restarts proper level if player dies in the lava.
- Level 4?
