# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1

  - Rendered horizon line. (See below)

### GOAL 2

  - Rendered lines in general in 3d.  Can also now render faces.

### GOAL 3  

  - Point line and face testing completed.    
  [Vector Tests](https://github.com/afg419/battlezone/blob/master/test/vector-test.js)  
  [Point Tests](https://github.com/afg419/battlezone/blob/master/test/point-test.js)  
  [Edge Tests](https://github.com/afg419/battlezone/blob/master/test/edge-test.js)  
  [Face Tests](https://github.com/afg419/battlezone/blob/master/test/face-test.js)  

## Next Steps?  

- Spherical collision detection from forward ('w') and backwards ('s'). (Should handle all of our collision concerns.)  
- Rendering faces correctly.  Presently faces don't know about distance to player and render in random order.  Causes perspective problems.  
- Render obstacles with collision spheres and event triggering on collision.  
- Collision causes player to stop moving (or die later).  
- Collision causes player to increase score.  

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns? THE PLAN:     

- Pivot game to collect objects for points in 3D environment.  
- Game has 3d motion (forward back, left right, loop up or down, barrel roll)  
- Environment includes stationary obstacles and stationary point boxes.  
- Timer present, with multiple modes of difficult on start up.
