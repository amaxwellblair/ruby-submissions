# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOALS COMPLETED FROM LAST CHECKIN

  - Spherical collision detection from forward ('w') and backwards ('s'). (Should handle all of our collision concerns.)  
  - Rendering faces correctly.  Presently faces don't know about distance to player and render in random order.  Causes perspective problems.  
  - Render obstacles with collision spheres and event triggering on collision.  
  - Collision causes player to stop moving (or die later).  
  - Collision causes player to increase score.  

### ADDITIONAL GOALS COMPLETED  

- Guns fire and can destroy booty boxes for points.  
- Ship moves with momentum.
- Turrets fire at player and can kill them.
- J key orients player towards nearest booty box. 
- F key orients player towards players direction of travel.
