- Player consumption

### GOAL 2
- Declare a winner

- We decided to model our game like the real agar.io game, which does not officially declare a winner. The goal is to be atop the leaderboard at all times. You can always be 'winning' but there is no finite beginning or end to a game and thus no declared 'winner.'

### GOAL 3
- Incorporate speed
- As the player grows their speed must decrease

-[Code for reducing speed as food is consumed](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/f6aab99bb56d8ab452b0b97674d54cf6cca60001/public/online-player.js#L46)

- We also introduced a feature that will briefly provide a speed boost
