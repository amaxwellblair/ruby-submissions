## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?
 - Yes.  It is a fully playable continuous multiplayer game.  The goal is to be the biggest player.  

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
- Multiplayer - we have a game that allows as many players as the server can handle.
[Server.js lines 59 -83](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/3a2ee23577ed2689b1598d64deb69cad46d7c795/server.js#L59-L83)

- WebSockets - we have WebSockets sending information back and forth between the server and the clients(players).
[Server](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/master/server.js)
[Client](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/master/public/client.js)

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?
 - [Websocket communication](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/3a2ee23577ed2689b1598d64deb69cad46d7c795/server.js#L59-L83)
 - [Canvas Scaling](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/3a2ee23577ed2689b1598d64deb69cad46d7c795/public/client.js#L231-L243)

## Risk Taking
We were told during our initial game proposal that our instructors "might suggest picking another game," so we feel the whole project was ambitious and something of a risk. Namely, we tackled a real-time updating multi-player game in 10-days using a language we formally started learning 20-days ago. We're incredibly proud of what we produced.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- [Speed Boost Logic](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/b676f3a2376f3655a6793b631a28b5b4418b6833/public/online-player.js#L96-L100)
- [Partial Application](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/3a2ee23577ed2689b1598d64deb69cad46d7c795/public/online-player.js#L14-L28)


### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- [Eat Functions](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/b676f3a2376f3655a6793b631a28b5b4418b6833/public/online-player.js#L38-L72)
- These need to be refactored. We have a feeling this might be a good spot to use currying. We have a ton of repetition in our eat functions when we calculate the distance between objects for collision detection, but then we perform different actions depending on what set of objects have collided and weren't positive how to handle that.
- [Seed Functions](https://github.com/jecrockett/gametime/blob/87221f66b81fe4515a2b232150d4dbd3a354dad6/lib/food-generator.js#L13-L37)
- Similar to above.  All seed functions are very identical and could be refactored.

## Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 300)

190

## Playability Features

All present and then some

## Extensions

- MultiPlayer - 10
- Websockets - 20
- Canvas Expansion - 20

## Functional Expectations

35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

## User Interface

15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## Testing

30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite convers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.

## JavaScript Style

25 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

10 points - Five or fewer complaints
