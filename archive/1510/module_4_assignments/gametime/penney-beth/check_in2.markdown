# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1
_Create a Shape constructor which can handle creating at least one shape_
[Spoke](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/game-time/blob/master/lib/scripts/spoke.js)

  - *Questions, Comments, Concerns?*  
  Want help imagining the cleanest, DRYest version of this file, because we'll replicate it for the other shapes.

### GOAL 2
_Have two to four shape blocks rendering and with testing (not 100% exactly but some testing hooked up)._
[Test File](https://github.com/PenneyGadget/game-time/blob/master/test/game-test.js)

  - *Questions, Comments, Concerns?*
  Want help imagining what a good test suite would look like...
