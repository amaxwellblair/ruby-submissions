## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?

 - Absolutely! And it's fun, too!

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?

Per Extension:
- I don't think we ever had extensions explicitly requested. At checkin 3 we were asked to refactor engine.js which we did and removed about 200 lines of code from that file.

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?

Per Feature:
 - The gif animations! There's a lot of different animations going on to show when a tower is shooting and most towers are also shooting directly toward the enemies.
 - [Animation](https://github.com/ToniRib/game_time/blob/master/lib/animation.js)
 - [Animation Engine](https://github.com/ToniRib/game_time/blob/master/lib/animation-engine.js)

## Risk Taking

- What risks did you feel you took on this project?
  - We chose a game that hadn't been done at Turing before (at least that we had ever seen) and that would require a lot of real time animations and visual feedback. It really let us turn this game from something mildly interesting to something that's actually fun to play!
- How do you feel about those risks?
  - We think they turned out great! We could have easily only done the basics, which is where we were late last week, but the game wasn't much fun to play because you had no idea when a tower was shooting.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[Enemy Shooting Functionality](https://github.com/ToniRib/game_time/blob/ef84e7fa1701a2ac3979b1f68d98142fdfe12533/lib/tower.js#L6-L36)

One of the first things we had to do when making the game was figure out how to get the towers to shoot only at enemies within their range and only after a certain amount of time has passed. I think we did a pretty good job by coming up with a way to determine if they are able to shoot and a way to figure out which enemies are close enough to shoot at (but are also on the visible canvas).

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[Board Tile Highlighting](https://github.com/ToniRib/game_time/blob/ef84e7fa1701a2ac3979b1f68d98142fdfe12533/lib/board.js#L60-L72)

This code got messy pretty quickly because there are so many cases to consider. We wanted to highlight build tiles one color if they were vacant and another color if they had a tower on them, but we also had to make sure we would only have one tile highlighted at a time. Since there are so many possibilities, we ended out having this big if statement in the Board object which I don't like it.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

It's easier to show it in the browser since that is what we used.

### Test Breakdown
- How Many Unit Tests?
- How Many Feature/Integration Tests?

I don't really know how to answer this because we didn't split them up into separate folders. We had 188 tests overall.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a unit test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

[Tower Cannot Fire Case](https://github.com/ToniRib/game_time/blob/99fd221221aa04c690d3108259a99b8242ef2eab/test/continuous-fire-tower-test.js#L58-L63)

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a feature test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

[Edge Case](https://github.com/ToniRib/game_time/blob/99fd221221aa04c690d3108259a99b8242ef2eab/test/board-test.js#L59-L73)

## Instructor Feedback

- Points: 135
- 
## Evaluation Rubric

There are 300 total available points for this project.

150 are available at each of three check-ins and are at instructor descretion.

Teams must complete the [submission form prior to each check-in](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1510/module_4_assignments/gametime/template).

150 out of a total of 300 points are included in the rubric below. The additional 150 feature points will be determined during iteration planning with instructors during check-ins.

### Functional Expectations

* **35 points** - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

### User Interface

* **15 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* **25 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* **20 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* **25 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* **15 points** - Zero complaints
