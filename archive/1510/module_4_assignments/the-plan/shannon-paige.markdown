# Name:

### Which Assignments and Why?
- Goals and Job Stalking
- Goals, because it was required...but I probably would have chosen it anyway because
I'm a crazy planner person and I like the idea of having a game plan for the next month.
- Job Stalking, because I am still really unsure about where I want to go. My dad is a sports writer,
who doesn't actually like sports that much, he just loves to write. He always told
me that if I loved what I did it didn't matter who I did it for. While that's a great sentiment,
its definitely put me in the mindset that I don't really care where I end up, and I need
to put more thought into it.
