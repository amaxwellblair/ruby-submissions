# Name: David Stinnette

### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
  - Goals
  - Side hustle
- Why did you choose these assignments?
  - One was mandatory
  - I'm building an actual app with an actual friend in an attempt to stay
    sharp with my programming skills and maybe, someday, sell it for a boatload
    of cash

### Submitted Assignments

### Goals

- Learn Go
  - Started from the bottom now I'm here (...still at the bottom)
  - What does success look like? I'm able to build an app or make something 'do
    the thing' many times over with Go
  - Resources
    - [A tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
    - [Get familiar with Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker)
    - The French King (and other Turing Go fans)
  - This project is important to me for two reasons:
    - Allstate, a company I'm applying to, loves Go
    - Fluency in multiple languages is a plus, and I starting with one that
      interests me

- Build side project described below
  - Started from the bottom now I'm here (...still at the bottom)
  - What does success look like? We're building out our goals and timelines as
    we speak. A year from now? We'll surely have multiple front end versions
    serving several target industries. I'll dabble in sales when time permits.
  - Resources
    - This is a Rails app with JS client side magic, so I'll be reinforcing
      what I've learned at Turing.
    - Turing mentors are always great help
    - I plan on being more active in the meetup scene in order to make new
      friends and mentors
  - This project is important to me because it's an opportunity to gain
    experience as a founder and stay sharp while kicking off this new career

- Learn to juggle
  - Started from the bottom now I'm here (...still at the bottom)
  - Define what success looks like after 1 year - Juggle like a bawss. We're
    talking chainsaws, swords, torches, the whole 9. Seriously, sonnets will be
    written about my juggling prowess.
  - Why juggling? It's important to have hobbies outside of tech, it will
    stretch my mind in a completely different way than coding does, and it will
    improve my coordination. Additionally, juggling is both dope and tight.
  - Resources
    - [Learn how to juggle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QfqkSPxmo)
  - This project is important to me for two reasons:
    - Juggling is dope
    - Juggling is also tight

### Side Hustle

- For each side project:
  - What is my 'MVP' for this project?
    - A database that serves up data to a client side app. I'm responsible for
      all backend functionality, my partner will design and create the front
  - Outline future iterations for this project
    - This database will feed multiple client side apps and multiple industries
      via an API
  - Why do I want to build this side project?
    - Stay sharp with my coding skillz
    - Obtain real world experience as a founder
    - Get all of the monies
  - How do I plan to stay on track with completing or working on this project?
      - My partner and I are outlining goals and milestones as we speak
  - Is there anyone I would want to get involved in working on or code reviewing
    this project?
      - Potentially. My partner seems to think his idea is the greatest thing
        since sliced bread and is weirdly protective of it. In reality, ideas
        are a dime a dozen and the only real thing that gets paid is hard work
        and hustle. If and when this project makes hay, we'll bring on mentors,
        more staff, etc.
  - How would I get this side project out into the world? Tweet about it? Submit
    it to ProductHunt?
      - You'll know this project has made it big time when I've bought a hot tub
        limousine and have it parked outside of Turing during hell week.
        Because hot tubs are a right, not a privilege. #HotTubsForAll
