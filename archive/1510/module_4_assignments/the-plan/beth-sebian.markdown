### Which Assignments and Why?
- **Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?**  
Goals and job hunting.

- **Why did you choose these assignments?**  
Aside from the fact that it was required, I chose to work on the goals assignment because I generally benefit from taking some time to examine my priorities in a given space. I entered Turing 7 months ago with a vague sense that it would provide some job security and be an outlet for some of my other interests. I know have a much deeper understanding of the options available to me and my own interests around the work. It's a good time given that background, for me to reexamine my goals for this field and my work ahead.

  I chose to focus on the job hunting assignment because it's something I would be doing otherwise. In my past life, I worked with a career counselor on a job search and I found the process to be a really helpful way for me to clarify my goals and understand my needs.
