### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
  - Goals and The Side Hustle
- Why did you choose these assignments?
  - Because it's important (and required) to have goals, and because side projects are important to me, and I definitely don't want to fall off the personal project coding train after finishing up at Turing.

### Submitted Assignments  
  
#Goals  

###Improve/Release my React Native App
  - Current goal state:
    - I have a basic functioning version of the app that needs more polish and features.
  - Success in one year will be an IOS and Andriod app available in the app stores that people enjoy using.
  - Resources for learning:
    - [This React Native tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial), [The official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html), [This React Native podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/react-native-radio/id1058647602?mt=2)
    - Potential Mentors:
        - Jan, Tute, Troy, Bret & Allie
    - Link to current project:  
      - [Ramble App](https://github.com/SteveOscar/Ramble_App)
    - Ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that I could give on this topic:  
      - The React Native community is still pretty new and small, but I could talk at a ReactJS meetup on the differences between ReactJS and React Native.   
    - List open source projects that relate to this goal  
      -One can [fork](https://code.facebook.com/projects/450791118411445/react-native/) the source code.
  - Why is this goal important to you?  
    -I want to evetually have mobile development be part of my career. Mobile development pays well, is often remote-friendly, and offers freelance and startup opportunities.  
  
###Get better at raw SQL
  - Current goal state:
    - The knowledge I've retained about raw SQL queries is light indeed, and it seems like a valuable skill to have.
  - Success in one year will be writing raw SQL queries without totally leaning on documentation, and also using more advanced techniques like EXPLAIN/ANALYZE.
  - Resources for learning:
    - [Khan Academy SQL resources](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql), [SQL podcast/radio stuff](http://www.sqlserverradio.com/), and referncing some of the Turing SQL lessons.
    - Potential Mentors:
        - Nate is good at that stuff.
    - Link to current project:  
      - Not currently working on SQL stuff.
    - Ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that I could give on this topic:  
      - Maybe talk at a Rails meetup about how/when raw SQL works better than ActiveRecord.
  - Why is this goal important to you?  
    -During my job hunt, I've seen a consistent desire for SQL skills among employers.  
  
###Add datasets/functionality/public API to my Ramble Map project.
  - Current goal state:
    - I think my Ramble Map project provides a unique perspective on travel expenses and trends, but it needs refining. Currently, users are often confused about what the numbers actually mean. I also want to offer an API on the data and add more datasets.
  - Success in one year will be accomplishing all of the above things, and have a consistent userbase. 
  - Resources for learning:
    - [How to implement tokenization on an API](https://blog.joshsoftware.com/2014/05/08/implementing-rails-apis-like-a-professional/), [More economic datasets](http://www.nber.org/data/)
    - Potential Mentors:
        - Tute
    - Link to current project:  
      - I recently built a few tokenized API endpoints on [Ramble Map](https://github.com/SteveOscar/ramble_map)
    - Ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that I could give on this topic:  
      - Best practices when tokenizing an API, such as requiring the token in the header instead of the URL for increased account security.   
  - Why is this goal important to you?  
    -This is my best project, and I think it will be a good platform to keep expanding as I learn new things. I also cannot find a similar application elsewhere online, so I think it offers something unique that people will actually use if I continue to improve it.   
  
#The Side Hustle  
  
###3 side project ideas:
  
####An application that lets colorblind people match colors, and compare that to the normal folks.  
-MVP: A simple interface that provides a sample color on one side, and a color slider on the other. A user slides the slider until the two colors match and the results are saved and can be viewed.  
-FUTURE ITERATIONS: Use web sockets to let people compare results remotely, making a little game out of it.  
-WHY BUILD THIS?: It seems like everyone is fascinated with comparing how they see colors vs other people.  
-STAYING ON TRACK: I'll tell people I'm going to build this. They will get excited and look forward to it. Then I will have to build it.  
-COLLABORATORS?: I think Jamie would be interested in working on this with me.  
-HOW WILL THE WORLD KNOW?: I think sharing a project like this on social media would work pretty well, if the project is done right.  
  

####Improve my movie suggestion site to offer some unique hook.  
-MVP: [The website](www.nonshittymovies.com) is already up and running, but it lacks a feature that really makes it unique, as there are plenty of sites that show movie ratings/suggestions. I think the tone is already unique, but I need  to implement location awareness to really provide targeted suggestions. 
-FUTURE ITERATIONS: I could let users chose the genres of movies they prefer to see, to further refine the suggestions process.  

-WHY BUILD THIS?: Because I've already started it and gotten some positive responses, but it's currently very bare-bones and needs some more work.  
-STAYING ON TRACK: I've been picking away at this project for a while, and it will continue to be something I turn to when I have a bit of free time and feel like some light and breezy coding.  
-COLLABORATORS?: I am a lone movie wolf.  
-HOW WILL THE WORLD KNOW?: Via social media and reddit, same way they know everything else. 
  
  
####Daily photo contest website.  
-MVP: An automated site that creates a photo contest topic in the morning, allows submissions and voting throughout the day, and shares the nightly winner on social media. No user accounts or anything, they can just enter a twitter name/email/website that will get shared with the winning photo.  

-FUTURE ITERATIONS: Allow user accounts to track various statistics and add more security features to prevent spamming the vote counts.  
-WHY BUILD THIS?: Because I like photography, and would enjoy building a platform that lets other people share their work.  
-STAYING ON TRACK: I think the MVP will be quite simple to build, and if people are interested in the concept, that will motivate me to continue working on it.  

-COLLABORATORS?: I don't think I'd need to collaborate, at least on the MVP.  
-HOW WILL THE WORLD KNOW?: Sharing it in various subreddits related to photogaphy would be a quick way to find relevant potential users.
