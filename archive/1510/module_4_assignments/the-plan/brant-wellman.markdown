# Name: Brant Wellman

### Which Assignments and Why?
- I chose the Side Hustle because I've had a couple ideas/unfinished projects from pre-Turing that I would really like to go back and explore now that I have some real skillz.

# Goals

Whether you're going right into a job, still job hunting, or repeating module 4 - you should work to identify goals for how you want to continue growing technically as a developer.

This could be something like 'learn GoLang', 'contribute to open source', 'improve my JavaScript abilities', 'build a weird thing'

At the end of module 3, you became a 'real developer' - so when you think about how to achieve these goals you should be thinking of them like a developer would. For example, if you walk in to an interview and say you know Go, that means you've built something in Go, not that you've taken a codeschool AND codacademy course in Go and followed along with a TODO app tutorial.

Focus on real ways you can demonstrate your learning and motivate yourself to keep at it.

### Identify

List three individual learning goals that you would like to accomplish over the next year.

### Define

For each goal:
  - State where you are currently at with this goal
    - e.g. 'I have given a lightning talk on Go', 'I downloaded EMACS', 'I am at an intermediate level with JavaScript'
  - Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Outline resources for learning
    - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
        - List meetups and conferences related to this goal (if relevant)
    - List ideas or links to things you could or are currently building to achieve this goal. (check out the side-hustle assignment)
    - List ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that you could give on this topic. (check out the community involvement assignment)
    - List open source projects that relate to this goal (check out the open source assignment)
  - Why is this goal important to you?  

### Goal - 1 => Become more proficient at consuming APIs with Rails  

 - I've consumed APIs in Mod3 through 2 projects and the final assessment, but I'm not at a point where I can do it very quickly and with a lot of confidence without accessing previous code examples. I can get it done, but I would like it to be with more speed.
 - After one year, success would be the ability to look at any api documentation and feel comfortable with knowing how to effectively consume any data that they may provide.
 - The most important piece to getting better at this will be practice. Attending the Rails meetup might provide some value.
 - Ultimately, with my goal of wanting to work with maps and to integrate different data sets into maps, this skill will become invaluable.

### Goal - 2 => Expand my skills using the Google Maps API  

 - I've integrated a Google Map with the Geocoder ruby gem into one Rails project, but I am far from comfortable doing it.
 - Being successful with this goal after a year would mean being able to show at least 3 projects with Google Maps integrated and consuming data and displaying it in different forms.
 - Over a year ago, I started a [project](https://github.com/brantwellman/ww-scouting) with the idea of integrating Google Maps and Youtube videos to assist white-water kayakers when they wanted to scout difficult rapids before actually going to the river. This would be a great place to start with this goal.
 - The Google Maps API page has a series of short tutorials that demonstrate different ways of integrating maps if I were to have a specific need and get stuck as to how to implement something. Udemy also has a course that may be worth looking into. I have also spoken with Steve P about this idea and he has offered himself as a resource as he feels comfortable integrating GMaps into projects.
 - Using maps is a personal passion of mine. I love the information that can be conveyed through exploring maps, and I would ultimately love to be working for a company that integrates them in their products.


### Goal - 3 => Learn React  

 - At this point in time, my only experience with React has been through the Creact tutorial and the lesson taught by Steve. I am not at a point where I would be comfortable building something with React.
 - Success after one year would be me being comfortable integrating React into an application and knowing what the advantages of doing so would be vs using another front end JS framework.  
 - Initial resources for learning include the Creact tutorial and the Turing School React lesson plan. The next step/level is the more advanced React tutorial that I have access to. I plan on looking for and attending the regional React meetup. The Facebook/React documentation actually looks like its pretty good and should also be a valuable resource.
 - The first thing that I would like to build with React is redoing Ideabox from the ground up while integrating React with it on the front end.
 - Once I get a little bit into the process of applying React, it would be good to reflect on my lessons learned and what helped me get out of the straight newbie phase. Documeting that in a blog post or a lightning talk would be a great way to contribute back to the community.
 - Learning React will satisfy two needs - 1) Its really cool, and the functionality that it provides is something that I am very interested in applying to projects. 2) It will help me be even more valuable in the marketplace as a more complete Full-Stack Developer.

# The Side Hustle

### Reading Assignment

- Read [6 Tricks for Successful Side Projects](https://quickleft.com/blog/6-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/)

### Idea 1

#### White-Water Tracker

- This is something that I started about a year ago, but really didn't know how to start or what I wanted the project to be. The idea is to make it easier for kayakers to scout rivers/rapids without actually being at the location. Many pov videos are being posted of folks going down rivers. There is a ton of information available through those videos that isn't being effectively accessed. If you can tag these videos on a map along with a date and water flows, kayakers (and rafters) will have very accurate information regarding what a river looks like at a specific level.  

  - An MVP for this could be not integrating videos, but simply tagging a map with locations and text information about the rapid.
  - The next iteration could be integrating this with Youtube so that videos can be tagged to the map. Another iteration could be a "social" aspect allowing users to comment on videos and "approve" the accuracy of the location of videos.
  - The target audience is white-water users who want to provide river scouting information and those that want to consume this information.
  - I've had an initial start on the project, but I'm not even sure what the current state of it is anymore. I need to review the code and then create some specific user-stories to drive the next steps.
  - Ultimately, I would love to release this to the white-water community through MountainBuzz and get feedback about the app. Real users will drive what is actually wanted.

### Idea 2

#### Movie Ranker

- This is another half-baked project that I have from a previous life. It allows a user to add movies to list and then rank those movies over the course of a year.

  - MVP for this project is allowing a user to add movies to a year, rank them, and change the rankings.
  - Additional iterations would allow users to see all of the "lists" on the site sorted by year and then also allow comments on the each others lists and rankings.
  - List makers and movie lovers are the target audience. Both of which describe me and my brother...I know there are more out there.
  - Again, I don't know the current state of this app, but now that I'm comfortable taking an agile approach to projects, there are clear iterations to this project that can be driven by user stories.
  - This also seems like a great project to apply some initial applications of React.
  - My release of the app probably wouldn't be as formal as my previous idea. I would release it to my family and friends that are also passionate about films and then ask them to share it with similar people as well.
