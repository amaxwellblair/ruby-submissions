- Goals and Side Hustle

###### Why did you choose these assignments?

- The Goals assignment was required, but I am so glad it was! What a great opportunity after all these months at Turing feeling like I don't have time to even _think_ about any of my own stuff to be given the time and space and do just that. I really appreciate how the assignment was laid out and the questions it made me delve into. I will for sure be referencing this assignment over the coming months to keep myself on track!

- The Side Hustle seemed like a natural progression after taking the time to set some concrete goals. I liked being able to lay out a plan for projects that really excite me and do a little research for them. It made those projects feel like things that can actually happen instead of just pipe dreams. I have felt pretty exhausted and beaten down this last week, but this assignment really helped me feel excited and reinvigorated again.
